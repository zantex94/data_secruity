            h2 40.5.3. Assignment Security DS.1.2 - One Time Pads
            p Do Create a program that is capable of creating a number of one time pads as text files. I would be useful if the length of each file and the number of files are parameters for the program. The content of the pads must, of course, be a totally random sequence of bytes. 
            p When the above is done and tested, create 5 one time pads of length 200 bytes. 
            p Modelled on Example 40.3 create a program reads both the plaintext, and the key from files, and then produces an output file containing the ciphertext of the encrypted plaintext. 
            p When that is done and tested. Encrypt a text, less than 200 bytes, with the first of the five one time pads. Hand in the 5 pads, and the file with the cryptotext. Our feedback will be encrypted with the second pad.
